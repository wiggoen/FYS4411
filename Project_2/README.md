# Variational Monte Carlo of Fermionic systems

In collaboration with [Line](https://github.com/linegpe).

## Ways of running the program (you can change the parameters given by default in the 'parameters.json' file):
- Python script (you have to change to the library/include paths to fit your installation of [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net))
  - [Python 3](py3-run.py) [relative link]
- Manually by running it in [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io) (you have to link [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net) to the .pro-file)
- Manually by using the command line with command line arguments (basically the same as the Python script provide)


## Running automatic tests of the code
Change the first line in [parameters.json](parameters.json) [relative link] file to <"Run tests": true,>.
The program will run the tests when executed.
