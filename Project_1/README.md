# Variational Monte Carlo of Bosonic systems

In collaboration with [Line](https://github.com/linegpe).

## Ways of running the program (you can change the parameters given by default):
- Python scripts (you have to change to the library/include paths to fit your installation of [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net).)
  - [Python 2](scripts/run.py) [relative link]
  - [Python 3](scripts/py3-run.py) [relative link]
- Manually by running it in [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io) (you have to link [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net) to the .pro-file)
- Manually by using the command line with command line arguments (basically the same as the Python scripts provide)
